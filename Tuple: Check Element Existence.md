# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'n'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `8` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
    x = ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 4, 6, 8, 10)
    print('n' in x)
    print(8 in x)

## Output

## Result
Thus, To write a Python program that checks if the element 'n' and the element 8 exist within a given tuple is verified and executed successfull.
