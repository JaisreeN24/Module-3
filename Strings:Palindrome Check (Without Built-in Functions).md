# Strings-Palindrome Check in Python (Without Built-in Functions)

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to check whether the string `"google"` is a **palindrome** or not, without using built-in palindrome checking functions.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Assign the string `"google"` to a variable.
2. Reverse the string manually using slicing (`[::-1]`).
3. Compare the original string with the reversed string.
   - If they are equal, print that the string is a palindrome.
   - Otherwise, print that it is not a palindrome.
4. Execute the program.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
      s = "google"
      rev = s[::-1]
      if s == rev:
          print("Palindrome")
      else:
          print("Not Palindrome")

## Output

## Result
Thus, To write a Python program to check whether the string "google" is a palindrome or not, without using built-in palindrome checking functions is verified and executed successfull.
