# List Operations in Python: Sum of List Items

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **sum of all elements** in a list.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a list of numbers.
2. Use Pythonâ€™s built-in `sum()` function to calculate the total.
3. Print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
      def createlist(N):
          l=[]
          for i in range(12,N):
              if i%2==0:
                  l.append(i)
          print("List =",l)
          print("Sum of the list",sum(l))
  

## Output
